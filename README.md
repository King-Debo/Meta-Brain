# Meta-Brain: A bio-cognitive architecture for artificial intelligence

## Introduction

Meta-Brain is a bio-cognitive architecture for artificial intelligence that simulates the human brain and cognitive processes. Meta-Brain is based on the principles of neuroscience, psychology, and computer science, and aims to create a general and adaptable intelligence that can learn from various sources of information and perform various tasks. Meta-Brain consists of the following components:

- Memory: This component stores and retrieves information from different types of memory, such as sensory, short-term, long-term, episodic, semantic, procedural, and emotional memory. Memory also encodes and decodes information in different formats, such as text, image, logic, and emotion.
- Attention: This component selects and focuses on the relevant and important information from the memory, and modulates the frequency and phase of the neural oscillations that correspond to the attention data, type, and format. Attention also changes the strength and coherence of the attention based on some saliency measures and filtering algorithms.
- Decision: This component makes the decision data, type, and format based on the attention data, type, and format, and stores them in the decision data, type, and format attributes. Decision also uses some decision rules and problem solving algorithms to make the decision, such as utility, probability, and optimization.
- Output: This component generates the output data, type, and format based on the decision data, type, and format, and stores them in the output data, type, and format attributes. Output also uses some generation models and expression algorithms to generate the output, such as GPT-3, VAE, and LSTM.
